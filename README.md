- [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co) Used as the base API for this app.
- [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/share/6702760f-c5cc-8002-84bf-c1e4e435b949) Used to bring together the multiple sources of documentation and conventions regarding Swift and folder structures. Almost every project has a different way of structuring their folders, and Apple's documentation is very vague on this as well.
- [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUkZv80F5lU) Used as a base to learn how to implement an API in Swift, and scpecifically to learn how to use the PokeAPI.
